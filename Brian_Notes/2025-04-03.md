# Development Notes

## 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- I successfully set up and configured the **ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin** locally, using **Poetry** for dependency management.
- I exposed my local FastAPI server to the internet using **Ngrok**, which allowed me to test the integration with external services. Ngrok made my local server publicly accessible, and I confirmed it was working as expected.

## 2. Custom GPT Integration
- I started setting up a **Custom GPT** in the **OpenAI platform** and integrated it with the **Retrieval Plugin** using the `/query` endpoint.
- I explored the **OpenAPI schema** and how the Custom GPT uses it to interact with my API, allowing it to query documents via the **POST /query** endpoint.

## 3. Testing
- I confirmed that the **Custom GPT** was able to successfully query my local server via Ngrok and return relevant results based on my search query ("latest project updates").
- By default, the **Custom GPT** can only access the `/query` endpoint, but I can expose additional endpoints (like `/upsert` and `/delete`) by modifying the OpenAPI schema.

## 4. Next Steps
- The **Custom GPT** integration is working, and I now have a functioning local server setup.
- I might want to expose more API functionality (like `/upsert`) by modifying the OpenAPI schema in the future.
